## CRUD

Mozilla definition [CRUD](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRUD)

```
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is an acronym for ways one can operate on stored data. It is a mnemonic for the four basic functions of persistent storage.  CRUD typically refers to operations performed in a database or datastore, but it can also apply to higher level functions of an application such as soft deletes where data is not actually deleted but marked as deleted via a status.

Mozilla definition [REST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST)

```
REST(Representational State Transfer) refers to a group of software architecture design constraints that bring about efficient, reliable and scalable distributed systems.

The basic idea of REST is that a resource, e.g. a document, is transferred via well-recognized, language-agnostic, and reliably standardized client/server interactions. Services are deemed RESTful when they adhere to these constraints.

Because HTTP, the standard protocol behind the "World Wide Web", "Web" also transfers documents and hypertext links, simple HTTP APIs are sometimes colloquially referred to as RESTful APIs, RESTful services, or REST services, although they don't necessarily adhere to all REST constraints. Beginners can assume a REST API means an HTTP service that can be called using standard web libraries and tools.
